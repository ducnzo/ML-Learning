    " Use noise data to generate new data. Primary goals: generate data (images, video, audio, or text) from a randomly generated vector of numbers called a latent space . \n",

    "#### Discriminator in GANs\n",
    "Discriminator network tries to diffetentiate between the real data and fake data (generated by generator nerwork). Generally, it's is binary classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding\n",
    " The essence of the two networks is that they are two opposite networks but together smarter. Generator try to generate the most realistic fake to fool the Discriminator. Discriminator was tricked will gradually get better at distinguishing more accurately. As a result, when Discriminator could not distinguish the fake image from the real image, we created a new image similar to the real image. \n",

    "Process is:\n",
    "1. Generator has never seen the real image but is trying to create an image that looks like the real thing.\n",
    "2. Discriminator tries to identify whether an image is real or fake\n",
    "3. In turn, Generator tries to fool the Discriminator into thinking that generated fake images are real deal by creating more realistic image over multiple iterations. \n",
    "4. Discriminator tries to outwit the Generator by continuing to refine its own criteria for determining a fake.\n",
    "5. They improve each other by providing feedback from the successful changes they make in their process in each iteration. This process is training of GAN.\n",
    "6. Finally, the process ends and attains a state known as 'Nash equilibrium' when Discriminator could not distinguish which image is real or fake. "
